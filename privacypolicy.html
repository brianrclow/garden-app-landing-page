<p>We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.</p>

<p>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We believe it's needed to enforce our legal agreements or that is legally required</li>
    <li>We believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues</li>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We take reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. But, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free and that we are just creating this app for a course project. In particular, email sent to or from the App may not be secure.</p>
